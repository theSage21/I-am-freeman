I wanted to recite a poem for a friend. I wrote the poem. I wanted Morgan's voice. Hence.


Steps
-----

1. [ ] Collect Morgan Freeman voice samples from youtube
2. [ ] Speak the dialogues in my own voice.
3. [ ] Convert both audios to spectrograms.
4. [ ] Use ML to regress from one image to another in training.
5. [ ] Record the poem.
6. [ ] Predict Morgan's voice.
7. [ ] Convert created spectrogram back to audio.
8. [ ] Send poem to friend.
